<br></strong>The Virus: It is an enveloped single-stranded RNA virus, the initial cases originated from Wuhan China. It causes respiratory illness in humans and other animals
<br>Disease: It causes acute respiratory illness
<br>
<br><strong>How does this spread? (Transmission)
<br></strong>Spread from person to person, through respiratory droplets - coughing or sneezing. Hence, maintain at least 2 meters or 6 feet distance between people.
<br>Direct contact with an infected person and their mucous membranes.
<br>Touching infected surfaces and then touching face, eyes, mouth or nose.
<br>
<br><strong>How long does the virus last in various places?
<br></strong>It can last in the air, through aerosols for at least 3 hours
<br>On plastic, metal and other smooth surfaces, this virus is viable for at least 72 hours. (3 days)
<br>On cardboard, it can last for about 24 hours.
<br>
<br><strong>What are the symptoms?
</strong><br>Symptoms generally start 3-5 days after the infection.
<br>1. <strong>Fever </strong>in 99 % of patients, the most common symptom.generally more than &gt;100 F
<br>2. <strong>Fatigue </strong>in 70 %,
<br>3. <strong>Dry cough</strong> in 59 %
<br>4. <strong>Anorexia </strong>in 40 %, loss of appetite
<br>5. <strong>Myalgias </strong>in 35 %, muscle ache
<br>6. <strong>Dyspnea </strong>in 31 %, difficulty breathing

<br><strong>What is the incubation period?
</strong><br>The incubation period for COVID-19 is thought to be within 14 days following exposure, with most cases occurring approximately four to five days after exposure
<br>Most cases occurring approximately five days after exposure
<br>In a family, the cluster of infections, the onset of fever and respiratory symptoms occurred approximately three to six days after presumptive exposure
<br>
<br><strong>How severe is the illness?
</strong><br>The spectrum of symptomatic infection ranges from mild to critical; most infections are not severe.
<br>1. Mild infection was seen in 81% of cases.
<br>2. Severe disease (eg, with dyspnea (difficulty in breathing), hypoxia, or &gt;50 percent lung involvement on imaging within 24 to 48 hours) was seen in 14 % cases.
<br>3. Critical disease (eg, needing a ventilator) was seen in 5 %.
<br>The overall case-fatality rate was 2.3 percent; no deaths were reported among noncritical cases.

Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, to be done frequently. Clean fingernails, between fingers, thumbs and wrist.&nbsp;There is no limit for washing hands, wash it every time after you touch surfaces that might be touched by others.<br>2. Hand sanitizer (with at least 60% alcohol/isopropyl alcohol), must be done after every use.
Only used if water and soap are not available. Make sure your hands are not soiled, sweaty or watery.
<br>3. Try to stay away from people who have any symptoms of the infection.
<br>4. Covering the mouth and nose while coughing  or sneezing.<br>5. Avoid touching the face (in particular eyes, nose, and mouth).
<br>6. Avoiding crowds (particularly in poorly ventilated spaces) if possible and avoiding close contact with ill individuals.
<br>7. Cleaning and disinfecting objects and surfaces that are frequently touched (like doorknobs, taps, water fountains, handles on public transport).
<br><br><strong>Does drinking alcohol help?</strong>&nbsp;NO, don't be a <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVIDIOT" target="_blank">#covidiot</a><br><br><strong>Are masks required for healthy individuals?
</strong><br>• <strong>Can be used</strong>: <strong>reusable</strong>, <strong>non-surgical masks will work</strong>, especially in public or crowded areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;Experts recommend not wear a face mask if you are not sick
<br>• <strong>Surgical and N95 masks are only for Healthcare professionals</strong> or people who are sick and/or are caring for the sick.
<br>• Only wear a surgical mask or N95 if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19.
<br>• Disposable face masks can only be used once. If you are not ill or looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide shortage of masks.&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>Strange times we live in. A virus known mainly for causing common cold comes out of nowhere and shows us how vulnerable the mighty human race is. I've been discussing with my peers and colleagues about this situation since early 2020 and started understanding about what this is all about. As a doctor the new information is difficult to process, then I see the people becoming Infectious disease expert with one Tweet!!🤦‍♂️
</p>
<h3>April</h3>
<p>People were getting a grip of whats happening. Hungry people flocking to NGO kitchens, Entitled people complaining about lack of access to weird things. Looking at the inefficiencies of the bureaucracy and the reluctance to change, a global pandemic had to come for them to think about adapting. Then had to take care of my grandfather, which caused more disdain for the Indian medical practice. Under-therapeutic doses, pushing non-standard managements, disregard of protocol and general lack of sympathy. The weird heard mentality, tribalism and inability to understand and verify things. The horrors of abject poverty again made fresh, internship was not a great time. Managed to get some financial education and started takeing responsibility like an adult. Realized never to blame anyone for things that are happening to me, there is always a way. Nothing in life is for free, from the free dinner you had somewhere to your girlfriend, everything and everyone has a price. I was missing my bed, lack of quality sleep is detrimental. 
</p>
<h3>March</h3>
<p>First cases appear in Kerala, India, some returning students from Wuhan. Kerala keeps dealing with such outbreaks quite often, so no harm I guess. Then Delhi, Mumbai and the first case in Bengaluru that to from a guy returning USA!. I still didn't worry as they government was contact tracing and testing them but with considerable delay, with only one lab in Pune. Then a circular that states that all inbound and outbound international flights from 22nd March will be stopped, sounds like the Pandemic just hit India. PM Modi announces "Janatha Curfew" and me thinking this sounds like a teaser to something else and bam! The Lockdown. And here I'm stuck in a strange place. With time on my hands I start pondering the internet for things to make sense, OpenWHO, Coursera and Osmosis.org were of great help. I register to volunteer in some Telegram group thinking might kill some time. Had a great time speaking to long lost friends and helping them make sense of this along with me as everyone had a unique story of their own. Certain questions was always prevalent "What next?", "Till when?", "What about my work", "Will I get infected". What next was simple, live with it!. Till when, I guess till a year or two, if you want to go back to normal like 2019, I would say 2022. What about my work, idk but all the government around the world are going to blame this for the looming recession that was due, might as well turn out to be a depression, who knows I'm not an economist. Will I get infected, hell NO, the chances of you getting TB or going into depression is much higher.What do I do, like in the old days when they kept a bucket of water outside the house, just do that and add a bar of soap and you are golden. Back home I was starting to get a grip of how stupid the 4th pillar of democracy was. I start consolidating all my online ventures into a newly bought website domain, rekindling my love for coding in the process and questioning my life choices, again. The boredom was killing me. Started gathering data about all the things regarding COVID-19, to see if the so famed community transmission has started in India, as everyone on Twitter was mentioning. ICMR was the doing random SARI surveillance in various Districts and the Health Department was doing some great work, but every other department looked like they were clueless. Speaking to people in different districts sounded like some fudging of number was on, but I had trust in the system as healthcare was not a compromise, at least where I live. </p>
<h3>January & February</h3>
<p>Seeing some weird illness going around in China, while I'm sitting in a club looking at the Chinese build hospitals in 10 days. Discussion about the self-medication with Azithromycin and Hydroxychloroquine. Booking flight tickets hoping the coronavirus doesn't affect me, that aged well.</p>
