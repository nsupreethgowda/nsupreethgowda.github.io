<br></strong>The Virus: It is an enveloped single-stranded RNA virus, the initial cases originated from Wuhan China. It causes respiratory illness in humans and other animals
<br>Disease: It causes acute respiratory illness
<br>
<br><strong>How does this spread? (Transmission)
<br></strong>Spread from person to person, through respiratory droplets - coughing or sneezing. Hence, maintain at least 2 meters or 6 feet distance between people.
<br>Direct contact with an infected person and their mucous membranes.
<br>Touching infected surfaces and then touching face, eyes, mouth or nose.
<br>
<br><strong>How long does the virus last in various places?
<br></strong>It can last in the air, through aerosols for at least 3 hours
<br>On plastic, metal and other smooth surfaces, this virus is viable for at least 72 hours. (3 days)
<br>On cardboard, it can last for about 24 hours.
<br>
<br><strong>What are the symptoms?
</strong><br>Symptoms generally start 3-5 days after the infection.
<br>1. <strong>Fever </strong>in 99 % of patients, the most common symptom.generally more than &gt;100 F
<br>2. <strong>Fatigue </strong>in 70 %,
<br>3. <strong>Dry cough</strong> in 59 %
<br>4. <strong>Anorexia </strong>in 40 %, loss of appetite
<br>5. <strong>Myalgias </strong>in 35 %, muscle ache
<br>6. <strong>Dyspnea </strong>in 31 %, difficulty breathing

<br><strong>What is the incubation period?
</strong><br>The incubation period for COVID-19 is thought to be within 14 days following exposure, with most cases occurring approximately four to five days after exposure
<br>Most cases occurring approximately five days after exposure
<br>In a family, the cluster of infections, the onset of fever and respiratory symptoms occurred approximately three to six days after presumptive exposure
<br>
<br><strong>How severe is the illness?
</strong><br>The spectrum of symptomatic infection ranges from mild to critical; most infections are not severe.
<br>1. Mild infection was seen in 81% of cases.
<br>2. Severe disease (eg, with dyspnea (difficulty in breathing), hypoxia, or &gt;50 percent lung involvement on imaging within 24 to 48 hours) was seen in 14 % cases.
<br>3. Critical disease (eg, needing a ventilator) was seen in 5 %.
<br>The overall case-fatality rate was 2.3 percent; no deaths were reported among noncritical cases.

Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, to be done frequently. Clean fingernails, between fingers, thumbs and wrist.&nbsp;There is no limit for washing hands, wash it every time after you touch surfaces that might be touched by others.<br>2.

<br>3. Try to stay away from people who have any symptoms of the infection.
<br>4. Covering the mouth and nose while coughing  or sneezing.<br>5. Avoid touching the face (in particular eyes, nose, and mouth).
<br>6. Avoiding crowds (particularly in poorly ventilated spaces) if possible and avoiding close contact with ill individuals.
<br>7. Cleaning and disinfecting objects and surfaces that are frequently touched (like doorknobs, taps, water fountains, handles on public transport).
<br><br><strong>Does drinking alcohol help?</strong>&nbsp;NO, don't be a <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVIDIOT" target="_blank">#covidiot</a><br><br><strong>Are masks required for healthy individuals?
</strong><br>• <strong>Can be used</strong>: <strong>reusable</strong>, <strong>non-surgical masks will work</strong>, especially in public or crowded areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;Experts recommend not wear a face mask if you are not sick
<br>• <strong>Surgical and N95 masks are only for Healthcare professionals</strong> or people who are sick and/or are caring for the sick.
<br>• Only wear a surgical mask or N95 if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19.
<br>• Disposable face masks can only be used once. If you are not ill or looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide shortage of masks.&nbsp;<br></p>
