244! That number is going make or break my future. At least that is what I'm told. "Your step 1 score is what is going to determine the residency you get into". Sounds like a magical solution that I've been hearing for the past 10-15years. And all this seems like a sham to keep us up in the rat race! All this started in the 10th boards, get this great grades and it sort you for life. Like most things a decade ago, I with some convincing thought it was the way for me. Little did I know that this was just the beginning for a long boring journey. The start of never ending saga of giving exams.

My decision to not stay in India stems from the fact that my professional and personal growth were just looking at stagnation. As a child we never stayed at a place for long, and now I was staring at my life in a sleeping 'Retiree's Paradise'. Not that I hate this place, but it makes me feel content and comfortable. That in my opinion is not a good thing. I've started to believe that constant learning and challenging yourself with new things and experiences is must to grow as a human being. And getting far away as possible made sense.

The decision at first was very easy, a buddy of mine showed me how much fun it might be. "If you are not doing anything here, then get out of here." Sounded like a great idea. But upon giving it a serious thought, it was very complex. The final decision was taken as a family, with some heated exchanges at the dinner table. Understanding the implication of this was only understood once I had a conversation with my brother. Everything from my attitude to financial situation had to change. Things had to become more organized and less procrastinatory, for lack of a better term.

My academic aren't great, neither have I published anything yet. Only thing notable achievement as an adult is to be good at taking to people and understanding what they want from me, which is not quantifiable. People are going to give you an opportunity only if you show them you are worth it. So, now I had to start working on every aspect of my life.
