All this contact tracing has got me worried.

Do we really on our own lives and our data online?. Even though the government says we are using contacts of individual people to help them avoid getting infected, at the end of the day everything can get used for various purposes. Making the app open source was a good idea but the government is running a different version of the same open source software ,so nobody knows where the data is going. I'm worried because medical information is supposed to be held in utmost secrecy. However, this now is being handle by everyone other than a healthcare profession, who is supposed to maintaining the privacy of the patients. I've seen the way data scientist operate and they are insatiable for data. So naturally there was an outrage everywhere to this decision and saying this is an invasion of privacy, but isn't privacy already long gone.

I think,  early 2014/15 is when I discovered this extension on my browser which gave me a detailed analysis of the data Facebook had on me, how Facebook categorized me. It had 32 different variables from political preferences to sports liking to sexual orientation. Since then I have been more vigilant about my privacy and my data on the internet and have tried to eliminate the most intrusive apps and services. However sometimes I feel these services basically control most of what I do. I've given up on my viewing preferences, I watch what the algorithm tells me to watch, I order whatever the app recommends me to, and even though I know the route Google Maps is telling to how to go there. I have understood that nothing is free in life. Especially on the Internet because something or somebody is always watching and is ready to monetize every move you make. Because you are not the customer for their product, you are the product for them.

Prying on the vigilance of the general populous they came out with subscription models. Saying that this way you pat for their services. Due to the same reason I have subscribed to a few different things that I think are worth subscribing to so that I can avoid a lot of this intrusiveness into my personal life. However, the data crunching algorithm is always working, its just no selling your data. The day you stop paying them, then you go back to being the product.
