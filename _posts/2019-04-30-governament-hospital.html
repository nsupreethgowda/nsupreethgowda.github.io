<p>Writing this after all the dust has been settled with  my post-internship/graduation drama and has given me enough time to reflect on my year long ordeal. To sum it up, it was an overload of personal and professional experiences, a once in a lifetime opportunity that I'll never do again if given the opportunity. </p>
