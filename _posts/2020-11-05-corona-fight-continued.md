How could have I been so na√Øve? My post Corona virus recovery was literally painful. 

I thought that my two-week stay at the hospital and its associated isolation would be the last of it. It started off as just  fatigue then it started showing signs of something nefarious going on. Even though I was tired all the time I was unable to sleep and at the same time, I felt very hungry but was unable to eat. Slowly my sleeplessness became full-blown insomnia and it started taking a toll on my mental health. Even what little I could eat tasted very bitter even though my mind how these goods are supposed to taste. So basically, my sense of smell and taste were non-existent. 
A few days later, I truly felt what patients with arthritis go through. The weird feeling in a joint and the pain associated with it, joint feels like it has been filled with sand and you take extra precautions not move any of them. The first symptom of post-reactive arthritis for me was my left hip clicking whenever I got up from prone position to sitting, it almost felt like my head of the femur was slipping out of the acetabulum. Then it progressed to my knees, elbows, shoulders, and sacroiliac joint, all of them felt very stuffed and moving them around feel very gritty. 
I was on the course of Rivaroxabann Dexamethasone, Zinc sulphate, Ascorbic acid, and weekly Cholecalciferol with Acetaminophen p.r.n. The Dexamethasone and Acetaminophen help to an extent with the joint issue. But the sleeplessness, fatigue, loss of appetite and gustatory issues still prevalent even 2 weeks post-discharge. Zinc sulphate tablet made my gastritis worse but thankfully it was on an O.D dose. After 2 weeks rivaroxaban was replaced with enteric-coated Aspirin.
At this stage I felt very helpless for the fact that I could not talk to anybody or I could not meet anybody and my mind was so bogged down that I could not think straight for myself. It had been almost three weeks since my diagnosis then I finally decided to head out of the room.
I went for a morning walk, with an N95 mask and a tracksuit. That felt like the best decision my brain was able to take in a while and felt rejuvenating, the cold autumn air on my face and sun on my body,  Even though the mask prevented me from feeling the fresh air in my lungs but I could sense it be very different and refreshing. But this feeling was short-lived, soon after km I was exhausted and my join wanted to give way so I decided to limp back home to fight another day. But finally, in 2 weeks I felt like there was light at the end of the tunnel. And I also knew that this would require a lot of work.
So from the next day I requested my mum to give me e some extra protein with every meal, I got up very early in the morning so as to avoid any crowded areas and I made my way towards the foothills of Chamundi. I talk it slow even though I felt I could do a little more the girls this was about the long game. On the first day, all I could do slowly walk up to the foothills and head back. Then over the course of the week, I was able to walk in the foothills and climb about 500 stairs (about 1000 steps in total) and head back home. Even though this sounds like a great achievement but taking 1hr from something I was able to do in half an hour mean I had a long way to go.
